# Medtnerdex 

https://medtnerdex.com

This is a simple website that provides a sort of index of the great Russian composer Nikolai Medtner's compositional output. I'd like to do something of this nature on a grander scale (perhaps a more fleshed out version for more than one composer) but I had to begin with Medtner since I constantly need an easy reference to organize his compositions (and he's one of my favorite composers ever!).

The main interesting use for this tool is to organize pieces by year finished. The information was hand-typed by me using both Barrie Martyn's biography of Medtner and www.medtner.org.uk. More information will be added (I think organizing by key signatures will be interesting).
